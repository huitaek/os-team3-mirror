# Project 1 - Team 3

### High-level design

### Implementation

### How to build our kernel

### Investigation of the process tree

### What we've learned

In this very first project, we have learned some basic knowledge about linux kernel as well as how to use git in the real world. First of all, we have figured out the structure of `task_struct`, and the means to changing mode from the kernel mode to the user mode and vice versa. Also, we could understand why we have to make sure to lock task list before traversing along the process tree. Thanks to TAs, we have lessons with `ctags` and `cscope`, which were excessively helpful in this project. On the other hand, some of us used git for the first time, and it was a great time to learn how to use git in a team project.
