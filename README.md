# Team 3 - Project 2

This assignment includes implementing a new kernel synchronization primitive in Linux. It provides reader-writer lock based on device rotation.

This project consists of 3 parts in kernel and test respectively.

###1. Kernel part
* `rotlock_read` & `rotlock_write`: Acquires rotation lock.
* `rotunlock_read` & `rotunlock_write`: 

###2. Test part
* `set_rotation`
* `rotd`
* `selector` & `trial`
